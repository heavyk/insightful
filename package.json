    "I was admiring the previous author's work on brocast when I realized that our brains have a similar system to pub/sub. As the night progressed, I understood that there is more than just a messaging system. this is my experiment to see if I can replicate some of the key attributes.",
    "previously, I had also been admiring the code written in petkaantonov/FastEmitter and I noticed the whole domains bit, and led me to study those, why they are being removed from node, and it lead me to do a whole investigation on how our brains percieve errors. I hope I can explain it soon with the streams implementation."
