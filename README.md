# insightful

this project started out as local changes to [brocast](https://github.com/tounano/brocast). all credit goes to him for original implementations of the Pub/Sub functions. the rest of the inspiration came from [FastEmitter](https://github.com/petkaantonov/FastEmitter).

there are a lot of things in here that we use to create interfaces... kinda disorganized still. I'm also playing around with an idea where the interface kinda "learns" from the user.

anyway, more soon...
